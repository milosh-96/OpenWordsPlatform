<!-- We use Liquid files here, but you could do the same using the Admin Templates feature as well. A sample using Razor
     and a more complete presentation of the LayoutInjection widget can be found in the Sass sample project's
     implementation of this shape at Lombiq.BaseTheme.Samples/Views/Widget-LayoutInjection.cshtml. -->
<!-- By default, the zone-classes filter takes any comma or space separated list and adds its items to the indicated
     BaseTheme zone. If you provide the additional optional parameter "remove: true" then it removes the listed classes
     from the zone instead. -->

<!-- You can add contents to any zone, inject assets, and do anything else you can with a shape. -->
